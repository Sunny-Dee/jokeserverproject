/**
 * Name: Deliana Escobari       Date: Tuesday January 19th, 2015
 * Java version used: 1.8 
 * Compile with command: javac ModeWorker.java 
 * 		or java *.java once to compile all files in the whole folder
 * 
 * How to run this project:
 * 		In separate shell window open:
 * 				java JokeServer
 * 				java JokeClient
 * 				java JokeClientAdmin
 * 
 * 		All acceptable commands are displayed on the various consoles.
 * 		This runs across machines, in which case you have to pass the IP address of
 * 		the server to the clients. For example, if the server is running at
 * 		140.192.1.22 then you would type:
 * 				java JokeClient 140.192.1.22
 * 				java JokeClientAdmin 140.192.1.22
 * 
 * List of files needed for running the program.
 * 				JokeClient.java
 * 				JokeClientAdmin.java
 * 				JokeServer.java
 * 				ModeServer.java
 * 				ModeWorker.java
 * 				Worker.java
 * 				ClientState.java
 * 
 * Notes: Thread that processes a mode change. It is important to know that if the
 * user enters any character that is not j, p, or m, the system will go into the
 * default joke more.
